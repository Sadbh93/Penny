	<h2>Penny</h2>
<p>Penny is a typical teenager, trying to carve out independence away from her embarassing parents. She is a black feminist, very logical and often bratty. She's also a talented singer, footballer, journalist and straight A student.</p>

<h2 class="caption">Her Friends</h2>
<p>Unfortunately she often fails to live up to her potential, and spends most of her time in the company of other teenagers with whom she has quite toxic relationships. Her so called friends frequently lead her into dangerous situations and abandon her.
<br> Her friend's names are:<br>
<ol>
	<li>Dijonay</li>
	<li>Zoey</li>
	<li>LaCienega</li>
	<li>Sticky</li>
</ol></p>
